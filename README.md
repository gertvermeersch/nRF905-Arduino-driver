# nRF905-Arduino-driver
Open source driver for the nRF905

<h2>Driver for nRF905</h2>

This is a library to use the less popular RF905 tranceivers. 
As all units I received were designed for the 433Mhz spectrum the library uses this in the config. But with some changes
you could also get it working on 868Mhz.
The library is based on another lib I found a couple of years ago. It's not the most advanced but does what it must for communicating
with another chip.
I like this module because of the long range, compared to other modules like the NRF24L01.
